Game - Active Transportation and Demand Management (ATDM)
Application of Tools for Tactical and Strategic Decision-making for
Operations / Task 4: Data Collection and Research Plan
Study Number 071614</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This research study is under the direction of Dr. Samer Hamdar of the Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering, George Washington University, and paid for by the US Department of Transportation. 
Taking part in this research is entirely voluntary. Your academic standing and/or the status of your employment will not,
 in any way, be affected should you choose not to participate or if you decide to withdraw from the study at any time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this study is to provide guidelines on motivations that lead travelers to change 
their behavior when facing some disruptive events with and without Active Transportation and 
Demand Management (ATDM) tools. This will allow devising pricing and information provision strategies 
that lead to a less congested transportation system.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The part of the study consists of participating in an online game offered through the link below. 
The game consists of hypothetical travel choices and questions regarding your socio-economic 
characteristics, your travel patterns, and different attitudes/norms/motivations when faced with 
hypothetical travel conditions. Your answers will be recorded in an anonymous manner where no 
personal/private information will be linked to your answers (for example: email address/name â€¦etc.).
A game instance should take a maximum of 15 minutes. Your answers are expected at the end of the game 
instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The total amount of time you will spend in connection with this part of the study will be 
about 45 minutes a week (three game instances per week at your time/discretion and based on your 
schedules/convenience). We do hope you can participate for a total of 6-month duration between December 1st,
2016, and May 31st, 2017. You may refuse to answer any of the questions asked and you may stop your 
participation in this study at any time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The possible risks you may experience during this study are limited to a minimal risk of 
loss in confidentiality when recording your driving behavioral characteristics in relationship 
with your socio-demographical and physiological characteristics. 
The experiment may be stopped at anytime if any discomfort is felt by the participant.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You will not benefit directly from your participation in the study. The main benefits 
though are to science and to the commuter/traveler population population: this research is 
intended to allow understanding the motivations making some travel decisions even if detrimental 
to the transportation network performance. Such understanding through proper data collection generates 
new knowledge towards devising new demand management strategies leading to better traveler 
responsiveness and a mutually beneficial relationship between the users (i.e. travelers) and 
the suppliers (transportation officials) with less congested and safer surface transportation networks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential, however, this cannot be guaranteed;
 the investigators in this study will not use your name when specifying your socio-demographic 
  characteristics/physiological characteristics. Instead, pseudo-names (usernames) and subject IDs 
will be used to link between the traveler characteristics and the corresponding traveling behavior. 
Finally, all recorded information will be kept on servers and external hard disks owned by 
the George Washington University and used solely for research purposes. 
If results of this research study are reported in journals or at scientific meetings, 
the people who participated in this study will not be named or identified.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Office of Human Research of George Washington University, at telephone number (202)-994-2715, 
can provide further information about your rights as a research participant. 
Further information regarding this study may be obtained by contacting Dr. Samer Hamdar, 
the research lead investigator, at telephone number (202)-994-6652.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure anonymity, your signature is not required. Your willingness to participate in this research study is implied if you proceed replying to the announcement email or participating in the survey.
